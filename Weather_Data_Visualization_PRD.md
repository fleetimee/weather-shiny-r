- Interactive data exploration techniques
- Understanding relationships between meteorological variables

### Target Audience

**Primary Users:** Students learning data visualization and basic statistics
**Secondary Users:** Educators teaching data analysis, statistics, or meteorology courses
**User Level:** Beginner to intermediate data analysis experience

### Key Success Metrics

- Students can correctly identify appropriate chart types for different data relationships
- 95% of users can successfully create visualizations within 5 minutes of first use
- Application loads and responds within 3 seconds on typical student laptops
- Zero critical errors during normal operation

---

## Data Context and Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The application uses the `Opo.csv` dataset containing 366 daily weather observations with 22 meteorological variables.

### Variable Categories

#### Continuous Numerical Variables (18 variables)

Ideal for scatter plots and trend analysis:

**Temperature Measurements:**

- `MinTemp`: Daily minimum temperature (째C)
- `MaxTemp`: Daily maximum temperature (째C)
- `Temp9am`: Temperature at 9 AM (째C)
- `Temp3pm`: Temperature at 3 PM (째C)

**Precipitation and Evaporation:**

- `Rainfall`: Daily rainfall amount (mm)
- `Evaporation`: Daily evaporation (mm)
- `RISK_MM`: Risk of rainfall amount (mm)

**Wind Measurements:**

- `WindGustSpeed`: Maximum wind gust speed (km/h)
- `WindSpeed9am`: Wind speed at 9 AM (km/h)
- `WindSpeed3pm`: Wind speed at 3 PM (km/h)

**Atmospheric Conditions:**

- `Sunshine`: Daily sunshine hours
- `Humidity9am`: Relative humidity at 9 AM (%)
- `Humidity3pm`: Relative humidity at 3 PM (%)
- `Pressure9am`: Atmospheric pressure at 9 AM (hPa)
- `Pressure3pm`: Atmospheric pressure at 3 PM (hPa)
- `Cloud9am`: Cloud coverage at 9 AM (oktas)
- `Cloud3pm`: Cloud coverage at 3 PM (oktas)

#### Categorical Variables (4 variables)

Ideal for bar charts and frequency analysis:

**Wind Direction:**

- `WindGustDir`: Direction of maximum wind gust
- `WindDir9am`: Wind direction at 9 AM
- `WindDir3pm`: Wind direction at 3 PM

**Rain Indicators:**

- `RainToday`: Whether it rained today (Yes/No)
- `RainTomorrow`: Whether it will rain tomorrow (Yes/No)

### Data Quality Considerations

- Dataset contains 366 complete daily observations
- Some variables may have missing values (marked as NA)
- All temperature values are in Celsius
- Wind directions use standard compass notation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- Pressure values in hectopascals (hPa)
