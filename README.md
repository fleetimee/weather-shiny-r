### Running the Application

#### Method 1: Using RStudio (Recommended)

1. Open RStudio
2. Open the `app.R` file
3. Click the "Run App" button in RStudio
4. The application will open in your default browser or RStudio viewer

#### Method 2: Using R Console

```r
# Set working directory to the app folder
setwd("path/to/your/app/directory")

# Run the app
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

#### Method 3: Using R Command Line

```r
# From the app directory
R -e "shiny::runApp('app.R')"
```

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Variable Selection

- Use the **X-Axis Variable** dropdown to select your independent variable
- Use the **Y-Axis Variable** dropdown to select your dependent variable
- Variables are grouped by category (Temperature, Wind, Precipitation, etc.)

### 2. Chart Type Selection

Choose from three visualization types:

- **Scatter Plot**: Best for exploring relationships between two continuous variables
- **Line Plot**: Ideal for showing trends and patterns over sequences
- **Bar Chart**: Perfect for comparing categories or showing distributions

### 3. Interactive Features

- **Hover**: Move your mouse over data points to see exact values
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or zoom controls to examine data regions in detail
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around zoomed plots
- **Download**: Export plots as PNG files or download data as CSV

### 4. Educational Guidance

- Watch for **chart recommendations** that appear based on your variable selections
- Read the **educational notes** in the sidebar for visualization tips
- Use the **Help tab** for comprehensive instructions and dataset information

### 5. Data Exploration

- Switch to the **Data Table tab** to examine raw data
- Use search, sort, and filter features to find specific observations
- Export filtered data for further analysis
